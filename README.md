# sta243-compstats
The main emphasize of this course is not on providing a list of computational algorithms for statistical problem, and their implementations in a programming language. Rather, the core emphasize is on understanding the main principles behind the computational algorithms used in statistics. The primary purpose will be to introduce the interplay between statistics and computation.
